## Idea for data analysis
As I was brainstorming ideas and running through databases for cool json and CSV datasets I came across this really cool website called [Organise Your Music](http://organizeyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com/index.html#). What it does is, it establishes a connection with your Spotify account and runs a script that collects information about what kind of genre music is in your libray as well as a multidue of different characteristics, such as energy, valence, danceability etc. about each song.

## Graph 1. What kind of music do I listen to mostly?
